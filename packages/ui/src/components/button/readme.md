```
Buttons allow users to perform an action or mark a selection.
They’re used for similar, task-based options within a workflow, and are ideal for interfaces where buttons aren’t meant to draw a lot of attention.
For the One Button Application V2, only two types of Button will be provided.
```

## Examples

```
import { Button } from '@yds/ui';

<Button text="Button" />
<Button text="Button" disabled />
<Button variant="Outlined" text="Outlined Button" />
<Button variant="Outlined" text="Outlined" disabled />
```
